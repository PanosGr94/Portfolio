## Web Development


##### ESNUnipi Website ( 2017/2018 )

Working the IT section of a team of dedicated students, I uploaded and managed the events, group members, front-page news as well 
as the application forms to inform and help students coming to Greece through the Erasmus+ program stay up-to-date.
The Erasmus Student Network University of Piraeus website itself is managed through a custom 
ESN theme on the **Drupal CMS** which I used for editing. Some models were tweaked with personal html elements.

##### CossyLab Design Rehaul ( 2017 )

For 4 months I was asked by a university professor to work on remodeling the UI aspects of a website 
used for one of my his labs. It consisted of using the **Drupal CMS** to recreate an [old model](http://tum.ds.unipi.gr/) 
of the website using Drupal themes and plugins. Some custom css was needed. I worked on my own and presented
the new website for feedback twice following advice from my professor.

##### TedxUniversityofPiraeus Website ( 2016/2017 )

Working in a team of 5 with 3 Web Developers and 2 Web Designers , I participated in the development of the website 
for the University of Piraeus Tedx event page using **Wordpress CMS** and 
theme documentation to create an attractive and eye-catching experience to the users. The website uses plugins for 
maps and social media as well as a lot of custom css code for specific detail like the color of the brand and custom sizes.
